CYBER THREAT KNOWLEDGEBASE 🧠

With the overwhelming number of acronyms, attack typologies, technical tools, and types of actors, this tool brings together their definitions and allows users to explore how they interact each other. 📊

Key features of the tool 🎯
 - Dynamic search and filterable glossary: Access clear definitions grouped into four key categories — cyber attackers, cyber attacks, physical targets, and digital targets.
- Interactive mapping: Visualize connections between cyber attackers, types of attacks, and their targets (both virtual and physical). Targets are shown in green, actors in red, and the tools used in blue.
